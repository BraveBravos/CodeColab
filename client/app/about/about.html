        <h3>About Us</h3> 

        <div class='description'>
            <p>
                CodeColab is a live editing suite enabling programmers to remotely work in the same files simultaneously, commit and push to GitHub, communicate over video chat, and deploy their application to Heroku, all in one seamless experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                We were inspired by our previous experiences collaborating on projects and wanted the ability to work together in real-time without the search for external means of communication and constant rebasing hassles just to keep each other up to date.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the collaboration workflow, we were successfully able to eliminate conflicts and rebasing altogether, as well as automate branch creation and simplify the commit and pull request process.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a bonus feature, we thought the next logical step was running the software. We utilized the Heroku API to deploy the code, allowing users to test for bugs and functionality before committing to the master repositories.
